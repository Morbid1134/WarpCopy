/*
 * copy_engine.c
 * Performs actual file copying with minimal logic between reading and writing file data.
 * Each thread processes one file at a time, dynamically allocating as much memory as needed for the file size and system limits.
 * Files larger than available memory are split into chunks that fit comfortably in RAM, with allocation adjusted at runtime.

// copy_worker_thread():
//   Loop:
//     a. Fetch next file task from work queue
//     b. If no more tasks, exit loop
//     c. Open source and destination files
//     d. Determine file size
//     e. Dynamically allocate as much memory as possible for this file, considering system and process limits
//     f. If file fits in allocated memory:
//         - Read entire file into memory
//         - Write buffer to destination
//         - Free buffer
//     g. Else (file too large for available memory):
//         - While not EOF:
//             - Allocate largest safe buffer chunk
//             - Read chunk from source
//             - Write chunk to destination
//             - Free buffer
//     h. On success, update resume index
//     i. On error, log and optionally retry
//   Support for file attribute copying, timestamps, etc.
